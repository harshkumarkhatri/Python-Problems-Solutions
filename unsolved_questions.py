"""A website requires the users to input username and password to register. Write a
program to check the validity of password input by users.
Following are the criteria for checking the password:
1. At least 1 letter between [a-z]

1. At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
3. At least 1 character from [$#@]
4. Minimum length of transaction password: 6
5. Maximum length of transaction password: 12
Your program should accept a sequence of comma separated passwords and will
check them according to the above criteria. Passwords that match the criteria
are to be printed, each separated by a comma.
Example
If the following passwords are given as input to the program:
ABd1234@1,a F1#,2w3E*,2We3345
Then, the output of the program should be:
ABd1234@1
